Coffee Sales Analysis Project in Excel! 

I just completed an analytics project where I worked with raw datasets containing orders, customers, and product details. 

My goal was to clean, merge, and analyze the data to build a simple but insightful dashboard showing total sales, top customers, product trends, and country-level performance.

Here’s what I accomplished:
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Organized and structured raw sheets (Orders, Customers, Products)
Ensured consistent data types and corrected missing entries
Standardized fields like coffee type, roast type, and sizes

2. Data Merging Using INDEX + MATCH
Since I’m using a version of Excel that does not yet support XLOOKUP, I relied on INDEX + MATCH to pull information from the Customers and Products tables into the Orders sheet.
 
This allowed me to retrieve customer names, emails, countries, product details, and pricing with accuracy and flexibility.

3. Calculated Fields & KPIs
Computed Unit Price, Quantity, and Sales
Added indicators such as Loyalty Card, Roast Type Name, and Coffee Category

4. Dashboard Development
Built interactive visuals including:
Total Sales summary
Sales by Country (bar chart)
Top 5 Customers
Product performance breakdown

The final dashboard gives a clear view of customer behavior, product demand, and overall revenue insights.

This project strengthened my Excel skills in data modeling, lookup functions, pivot tables, and dashboard reporting, all using standard tools available in non-365 Excel versions.

I'd really appreciate any feedback from the Excel and data community.
Whether on my approach, formulas, or dashboard design. I'm always looking to improve and learn from others.
